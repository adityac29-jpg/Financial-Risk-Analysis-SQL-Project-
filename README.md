# #  Financial Risk Analysis (SQL Project)

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing financial loan data using **SQL** to assess loan approval patterns, default risk, and key financial predictors. The analysis simulates a real-world **banking/fintech risk assessment** scenario, helping identify high-risk customer profiles and factors influencing loan decisions.

##  Database Details

* **Database Name:** `Financial_risk`
* **Primary Table:** `loan_data`

The dataset contains customer demographics, financial metrics, credit behavior, and loan outcomes, enabling end-to-end risk analysis.

##  Key Business Questions Answered

The project answers critical risk and approval-related questions, including:

1. Total number of loan applications and approval vs cancellation breakdown
2. Customer profiles most likely to default on loans
3. Key predictors of loan approval (income, credit score, DTI, employment, education)
4. Impact of Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio on risk score and approval rate
5. Relationship between credit history length and financial risk
6. Risk patterns across employment types and education levels
7. Effect of previous defaults and bankruptcy history on current risk
8. Influence of credit card utilization on risk score
9. Loan purposes most prone to defaults or rejection
10. Impact of monthly loan payments on approval rates
11. Financial ratios that best predict loan risk
12. Effect of marital status and dependents on loan risk
13. Risk-based customer segmentation for targeted loan strategies
